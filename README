These scripts build a slimmed down version of the GADM dataset with ADM_1
administrative units.

Place the gadm gpkg in the raw folder and run the scripts _in succession_.

These shapes should be small enough to serve on the web.

Usage: 

--- 

1 ) Run smallify (takes a LONG time)
    This writes each country's adm-units as geojson to ./out
2 ) Run buildGpkg 
    This pushes the geoJSON shapes to a gpkg database.
3 ) Run addProperMetadata
    This creates a second gpkg with proper metadata 

---

Todo: Proper metadata.
